# Supervised Machine Learning Using Classification Models

## DataScience Bootcamp Project 6 (Phase I) : WBS Coding School
Welcome to my sixth project in bootcamp & second project of Machine Learning using Classification models! This time I am predicting housing prices for a real estate consultancy by using several models of classification techniques in supervised machine learning.

## Objective :
To create a model to predict whether a house is expensive or not using Supervised Machine Learning.

## Project Overview :
This is the first Phase of project using Classification methodology. Real estate consultancy has a dataset containing a historical register of housing prices in Ames & Iowa â€”the actual prices at which the properties were sold. As a Data Scientist we have to classify whether a house is expensive or not using historical data of housing prices and features.

## Challenges :
- Explore the dataset of about 1500 Houses.
- Analyzt about 80 features.
- Try out the different models of classification to extract best results.

## Tasks :
- Import the dataset of 1500 houses.
- Explore the data & perform the data cleaning.
- Perform splitting over data.
- Selct the models to see which model gives best result.
- Perform Error Analysis.
- Fit the train data again(For Streamlit Competition within bootcamp Group)
- Perform predict on testing data & download the file with results(For Streamlit Competition within bootcamp Group)

## Skills & Tools :
- Colab & Jupyter Notebook
- Exploartory Analysis of Database(Reading,Cleaning)
- Splitting data by importing train_test_split file
- Pipeline & Preprocessor Creation
- Scikit Learn, Cross Validation
- Fitting the data
- Accuracy check of data
- Select the model giving highest accuracy for final submission.


## Deliverables : 
- The Google Colab Notebook files which contains different ML algorithms attached with this repository.[1](https://github.com/PriyankaSPawar/Data-Science-Supervised_Machine_Learning-Classification_Prediction_of_Housing_Prices/blob/main/I-Housing_Project%20-Using_Decision%20tree_grid.ipynb)

- Final submission file for Competition.[here](https://github.com/PriyankaSPawar/Data-Science-Supervised_Machine_Learning-Classification_Prediction_of_Housing_Prices/blob/main/Final_submission_Strimlit_Competition.csv)
- Medium Article of this Project found [here]()

## Recommendation for Further Analysis :
- Use LazyPredict which helps understand which models works better without any parameter tuning.
- Find out which is the best model for Prediction than KNN,DecisionTree,Random Forest.
